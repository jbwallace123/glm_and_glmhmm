(2020), we are going to model an animal's binary choice data during a decision-making task, so we will set `num_categories=2` because the animal only has two options available to it. We will also set `obs_dim = 1` because the dimensionality of the observation data is 1 (if we were also modeling, for example, the binned reaction time of the animal, we could set `obs_dim = 2`).  For the sake of simplicity, we will assume that an animal's choice in a particular state is only affected by the external stimulus associated with that particular trial, and its innate choice bias. Thus, we will set `input_dim = 2` and we will simulate input data that resembles sequences of stimuli in what follows.  In Ashwood et al. (2020), they found that many mice used 3 decision-making states when performing 2AFC tasks. We will, thus, set `num_states = 3`."
